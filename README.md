# Java Spring Boot CRUD Application

This project is a Java backend application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot and MySQL. The application provides a RESTful API to manage resources, facilitating easy integration and manipulation of data.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve existing records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Project Structure

- **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.
- **Service**: Contains the business logic for processing requests and interacting with the repository.
- **Repository**: Interfaces with the database to perform CRUD operations.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for managing resources:

- `GET /cloudvendor` - Retrieve all resources
- `GET /cloudvendor/{id}` - Retrieve a specific resource by ID
- `POST /cloudvendor` - Create a new resource
- `PUT /cloudvendor/{id}` - Update an existing resource by ID
- `DELETE /cloudvendor/{id}` - Delete a resource by ID

## Configuration

The database configuration can be adjusted in `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `src/main/resources/application.yaml` to match your local SQL database setup.

---

This project serves as a fundamental example of how to implement a RESTful API with basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot. It is designed to be a starting point for building more complex and feature-rich applications.
